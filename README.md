### **Project Description**

SnackSpy is a web application that acts as a high-tech security system for your snacks. Users upload a "before" photo of their snack and a later "after" photo. The application analyzes the two images to detect any tampering and presents a final result highlighting the differences.

### **The Problem (that definitely exists) üò†**

You know the feeling. You buy that one perfect snack you've been looking forward to all day. You leave it in the "safe" spot, only to come back and find a suspicious bite missing.

Your sibling, the prime suspect, looks you dead in the eye and says, "It wasn't me." Without proof, justice is not served, and your delicious snack is just a sad memory. This is a cold war fought over cookies.

### **The Solution (that nobody asked for)**

SnackSpy is the answer. By leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and a highly sophisticated sarcastic messaging system, we provide undeniable proof of snack tampering. Our forensic overlay highlights the exact location of the breach, creating a shareable report that can be used to bring perpetrators to justice.
